# Moth-Units
Do not. <br>
<h1>Tier 1 - PUPA</h1>
Pupae are small air units that carry a force projector shield and heavy armor, designed to sustain heavy damage as a meatshield.

<h1>Tier 2 - HAWK</h1>
Hawks fly around and fire sapping laser bolts which destroy air enemies. Highly effective against armored units. 

<h1>Tier 3 - LUNA</h1>
Lunas are concealed infiltrators which attack like a miniature Arkyid, spitting anti-ground shells and anti-air sapping lasers. They can also reveal themselves and spew disabling juice onto enemy buildings to stop their activity for one minute.

<h1>Tier 4 - POLYPHEMUS</h1>
Polyphemus attacks enemies and blocks using a set of two anti-armor lasers that increase in damage over time. They can also spew a mass of flak at close range.

<h1>Tier 5 - ATLAS</h1>
Atlas conceals all allies around it and attacks by firing long-range EMP missiles. They have a set of eight micro-scorches for self-defense.
